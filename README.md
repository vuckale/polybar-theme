![theme_screenshot](https://github.com/vuckale/polybar-theme/blob/master/screenshot.png?raw=true)

* Using [https://github.com/Templarian/MaterialDesign](https://github.com/Templarian/MaterialDesign) fonts 
* Most modules are configured to use scripts from [scripts](https://github.com/vuckale/polybar-theme/tree/master/scripts) directory but some run desktop environment (GNOME in this case) based commands like `gnome-control-center` etc. which can be easily configured.
* pulseaudio-control module taken from [https://github.com/marioortizmanero/polybar-pulseaudio-control](https://github.com/marioortizmanero/polybar-pulseaudio-control) but modified.

Further instructions on how to modify it and install it will be added
